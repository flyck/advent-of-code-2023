* Advent of Code

Snippets behind my advent of code challenges

** Goals

Advent of Code should be a fun learning experience to extend ones skills, maybe even in a new
language. It is not necessarily about being the fastest or the best.


What are my goals?
- [ ] for each function, show memory usage and speed
- [ ] bun monorepo setup
- [ ] bun debug setup
- [ ] use bun test runner instead of vitest
- [ ] github cicd pipeline
- [ ] changelog / semver
- [ ] dive into node array / map performance (x3)
- [ ] find a way to benchmark for speed comparison
